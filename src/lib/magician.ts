export const magician = "When the smoke clears, what is left?\nGoodbye, goodbye\n\nYou drop a kid in gasoline\nAnd give him a lit match\nAnd slap him on the ass\nWhen he lights himself aflame\nLike the man who pays his wife\n\nTwo hundred pounds to have sex\n\'Cause it\'s the only way he can cum\nLike the girl, born a princess\nToo early or too late\nWho waits and waits and knows she\'ll never be queen\n\nWhat\'s left?\nWhat\'s left?\n\nThe senile cat\'s incessant meow\nThe children\'s favourite canned cow\nThe soundtrack of an unkempt house\nThe soundtrack of an abandoned spouse\n\nWhat\'s left?\n\nThe whirring cogs of futile despair\nThe anguish of answered prayers\nThe writhing mass of moaning torment\n\nWhat\'s left?\n\nYou lure a fly to a blazing lamp\nShut the lid tight\nAnd watch it dance about\n\'Til it dies\nLike Sirin\'s chimp\nWho, when given a pen?\n\nDraws only the bars of its cage\nLike the gown unworn\nLike the lawn overgrown\nLike the car, all rust\nLike the lungs, black with tar\n\nLike the bones, black with dust\nLike the heart, black with shame\nLike the eyes, black with age\nLike the infant spinning in its formaldehyde grave\nLike his mouth still open, crying out to be saved\n\nWhat is left?\nWhat is left?\nWhat is left?\nWhat is left?\nI\'m hiding from the government\nAnd my fictional wife\nFrom my dreams and my memories\nI\'m hiding from my life\nI\'m hiding from you, I\'m hiding from you\nI\'m hiding from you\n\nI\'m hiding from my mistress\nAnd her dream sex texts\nI\'m hiding from my family\nI\'m hiding from the explanation\nOf all I\'ve been doing wrong\nI\'m hiding from you, I\'m hiding from you\nI\'m hiding from you\n\nI\'m hiding from your lips\nI\'m hiding from your mouth\nI\'m hiding from your room\nI\'m hiding from doubt\nI\'m hiding from living\nI\'m hiding from everything\n\nWhen did I meet you?\nMaybe three years ago\nSo much has happened since\nYou were a million fears ago\nSo many since have taken your place\n\nA million more things to keep me awake\nNo, I don\'t sleep any more\nI just rest my eyes\nI\'m running from your lips\n\nI\'m running from your cries\nYour convulsions that crack\nThe crust of the Earth\nYour pantomime moans\nSo forced, so rehearsed\n\nYou\'re the first I call\nBut I hate the sound of your voice\nI hate the words you use\nThe phrases you think so choice\nBut I\'d kiss you a million times\n\nIf you\'d only turn your head\nYou\'ll never turn your head\nJust like me, you\'re not alive\nYou\'re dead, you\'re dead\nIn the German Black Forest, of which I know nothing\n\nI dream you ride a black horse\nBack and forth, back and forth\nWith no compass to follow\nOr landmark to reach\nYou perambulate aimlessly through nondescript trees\n\nIn the nondescript forest\nOf which I know nothing\nAnd can\'t visualise\nSave your faint silhouette\nAnd I clutch and it evades\n\nAnd I awake from the dream\nNo, none of it\'s real\nI don\'t sleep, I don\'t sleep!\nI wander through cavernous thoughts and regret\nThrough nothingness, through sagas\n\nThat never took place\nYour kiss, never given\nAnd your touch, never felt\nYour words, never spoken\nYour gift, never dealt\n\nYour lies, all around\nYour deceit, infinite\nI\'m hiding from your never-ending torrent of shit\nLike the spouse happily married\nWho still lies alone\n\nLike the world-famous actor\nStill completely unknown\nLike the German Black Forest\nOf you, I know nothing\n\nI know not your eyes, your skin, your stench, your sins\nYour arms, your hold, your heart, your folds, your nails\nYour grip, your grin, your tics, your sex, your shame\nI know only your name\n\nWhat\'s left of the lover\nWho doesn\'t exist?\nWho knows not how many fantasies\nInvolve her kiss?\nWhat\'s left of the dreamer\n\nWho dreams, and dreams, and dreams, and dreams, and dreams\nBut thinks he isn\'t dreaming\nThinks he is free?\nAnd what of the endless, heedless, ennui?\nWill it leave me be? No!\n\nWhen the smoke clears, it remains your name\nWhen the smoke clears, it remains, it remains\nWhen the smoke clears, it reigns, it reigns\nWhen the smoke clears, it\'s all I\'ll have left\nLike\nLike the Magician who disappears from no one\nHe speaks until his lies become sound\nLike the Magician disappears and never reappears\n\nLike the Magician disappears from no one\nHe speaks until his voice becomes sand\nHe disappears after a while";
